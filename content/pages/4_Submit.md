Title: Submit

# Instructions

We welcome both 2-page abstracts, as well as research papers.
Abstracts are ideal for position papers or discussion papers of previously published work.
Research papers must contain original work, including novel technical contributions, demos, datasets, or early-stage research with experimental and preliminary results.
The accepted research papers (not the 2-page abstracts) will be published in the [ICWSM Workshop Proceedings (AAAI Press)](https://workshop-proceedings.icwsm.org/).

All papers must be submitted as high-resolution PDF files, formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style, for US Letter (8.5" x 11") paper, in English.
Please reference the [ICWSM 2024 Submission Guidelines](https://www.icwsm.org/2024/index.html/call_for_submissions.html#guidelines) for all information, but authors do not need to compile the ethics checklist required for submissions to the main research track of ICWSM.
Research papers are recommended to be 4 pages long, and must be at most 11 pages long, including only the main text and the references.
No source files (Word or LaTeX) are required at the time of submission for review; only the PDF file is permitted.
The copyright slug may be omitted in the initial submission phase.

Anonymity: The review is **double-blind**. Therefore, please anonymize your submission: do not put the author names or affiliations at the start of the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments in papers submitted for review.

Papers should be submitted here:
