In this talk, <b>Dr. Hanna E. Morris</b> <em>(Assistant Professor, University of Toronto)</em> will explore the climate-media-democracy nexus and examine the challenges that climate journalists face during moments of social unease. Drawing upon the main arguments developed in her forthcoming book entitled Apocalyptic Authoritarianism: Climate Crisis, Media, and Power (Oxford University Press), she will specifically focus on U.S. contexts and describe how national anxieties following the 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump have shaped and continue to shape American journalistic and political interpretations of the climate crisis in ways that severely limit how the crisis has come to be known, imagined, and contended with. In addition to interrogating the implications of these limitations, possible pathways forward for more robust forms of climate journalism will also be explored in this talk.
